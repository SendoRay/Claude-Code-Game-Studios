# Technical Preferences

<!-- Populated by /setup-engine. Updated as the user makes decisions throughout development. -->
<!-- All agents reference this file for project-specific standards and conventions. -->

## Engine & Language

- **Engine**: Godot 4.6
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Rendering**: Vulkan (Mobile) / Compatibility renderer for web fallback
- **Physics**: Jolt (Godot 4.6 default)

## Input & Platform

<!-- Written by /setup-engine. Read by /ux-design, /ux-review, /test-setup, /team-ui, and /dev-story -->
<!-- to scope interaction specs, test helpers, and implementation to the correct input methods. -->

- **Target Platforms**: PC, Mobile (iOS/Android)
- **Input Methods**: Keyboard/Mouse, Touch
- **Primary Input**: Keyboard/Mouse (PC), Touch (Mobile)
- **Gamepad Support**: None
- **Touch Support**: Full
- **Platform Notes**: Card drag-and-drop must work on both mouse and touch. All tap targets minimum 44x44px for mobile. No hover-only interactions (mobile has no hover state).

## Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `PlayerController`)
- **Variables**: snake_case (e.g., `move_speed`)
- **Signals/Events**: snake_case past tense (e.g., `health_changed`)
- **Files**: snake_case matching class (e.g., `player_controller.gd`)
- **Scenes/Prefabs**: PascalCase matching root node (e.g., `PlayerController.tscn`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)

## Performance Budgets

- **Target Framerate**: 60fps
- **Frame Budget**: 16.6ms
- **Draw Calls**: < 200 (2D card game — should be well within budget)
- **Memory Ceiling**: 512MB (mobile constraint)

## Testing

- **Framework**: GUT (Godot Unit Test) 9.x
- **Minimum Coverage**: Balance formulas and battle resolution must have 100% coverage
- **Required Tests**: Balance formulas, battle resolution logic, card stacking rules, AI expansion logic

## Forbidden Patterns

<!-- Add patterns that should never appear in this project's codebase -->
- [None configured yet — add as architectural decisions are made]

## Allowed Libraries / Addons

<!-- Add approved third-party dependencies here -->
- [None configured yet — add as dependencies are approved]

## Architecture Decisions Log

<!-- Quick reference linking to full ADRs in docs/architecture/ -->
- [No ADRs yet — use /architecture-decision to create one]

## Engine Specialists

- **Primary**: godot-specialist
- **Language/Code Specialist**: godot-gdscript-specialist (all .gd files)
- **Shader Specialist**: godot-shader-specialist (.gdshader files, VisualShader resources)
- **UI Specialist**: godot-specialist (no dedicated UI specialist — primary covers all UI)
- **Additional Specialists**: godot-gdextension-specialist (GDExtension / native C++ bindings only)
- **Routing Notes**: Invoke primary for architecture decisions, ADR validation, and cross-cutting code review. Invoke GDScript specialist for code quality, signal architecture, static typing enforcement, and GDScript idioms. Invoke shader specialist for material design and shader code. Invoke GDExtension specialist only when native extensions are involved.
